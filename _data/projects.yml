    <p> Mobile app / userscript pair that pings you when certain words e.g. "attendance" are said in a Google Meet so you can sleep or do other things in online class. Made during Hack the North 2020++, my first online hackathon. Some other features are a real-time transcript of everything being said in the class and being able to send canned responses to the chat from the mobile app. </p>

    <p> Project inspired by a game theory problem. </p>
  description_more: >
    <p> Summative project for a grade 10 computer science course. Chomp is a two-player game played on a 2D grid in which players take turns removing squares. Removing a square also removes all squares to the right and below it. The object of the game is to not take the top left square. In this project, the player plays against an algorithm that computes optimal strategy via a depth-first search / dynamic programming. </p>
