<p id="describe-text"> hi i'm marcus ðŸ‘‹ </p>


Hello! You might recognize me by the handles I use on most sites - `pidddgy` or `piddddgy`. I started programming in middle school through hackathons and since then have been really passionate about exploring computer science. In the past I spent a lot of time training for competitive programming contests like the [Canadian Computing Competition](https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing.html) at the University of Waterloo, and was a CCO qualifier in 2021. You can check out my profiles on various competitive programming sites like [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/piddddgy) and [Atcoder](https://atcoder.jp/users/piddddgy). I've also dabbled in open-source and was a [Google Code-in](https://codein.withgoogle.com/archive/) runner up under Sugar Labs, an organization that creates educational software for children. 

I'm currently in my sophomore year at the Woodlands Secondary School, where I help out with the computer science club and do stuff like prepare lessons, contests, outreach, etc.

Some other hobbies I have are dance and playing League of Legends (peak silver 1, adc/support main).
