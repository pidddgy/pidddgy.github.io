<p id="describe-text"> hello! i'm marcus ðŸ‘‹ </p>


You might recognize me by the handles I use on most sites - `pidddgy` or `piddddgy`. I started programming in middle school through hackathons and have been doing various computer science things ever since! I am currently looking to study math or CS in university. 

In the past I spent a lot of time training for competitive programming contests like the [Canadian Computing Competition](https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing.html) held by the University of Waterloo, and was a CCO qualifier in 2021. Also, I've dabbled in open-source and was a 2019 [Google Code-in](https://codein.withgoogle.com/archive/) runner up under Sugar Labs, an organization that develops educational software for children. 

Currently I'm 17 years old and in my junior year at the Woodlands Secondary School, where I help out with the computer science club doing stuff like preparing lessons/contests, outreach, etc. Some other hobbies I have are dance and playing League of Legends. I've also written a few math contests, and hope to do more in the future. 

I was an [ESPR](https://espr-camp.org/) student in late 2021 which was very impactful in many ways, and I strongly recommend it for people who enjoy thinking about things and want to lead a more fulfilling life. 

Discord DMs open @ `doot#7684`, I don't bite :)
