<p id="describe-text"> hi i'm marcus ðŸ‘‹ </p>


Hello! You might recognize me by the handles I use on most sites - `pidddgy` or `piddddgy`. I started programming in middle school through hackathons and have since developed a passion for exploring computer science. 

In the past I spent a lot of time training for competitive programming contests like the [Canadian Computing Competition](https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing.html) held by the University of Waterloo, and was a CCO qualifier in 2021. You can check out my profiles on various competitive programming sites like [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/piddddgy) and [Atcoder](https://atcoder.jp/users/piddddgy). I've also dabbled in open-source and was a 2019 [Google Code-in](https://codein.withgoogle.com/archive/) runner up under Sugar Labs, an organization that develops educational software for children. 

I'm currently 16 years old and in my sophomore year at the Woodlands Secondary School, where I help out with the computer science club doing stuff like preparing lessons/contests, outreach, etc.

Some other hobbies I have are dance and playing League of Legends (peak silver 1 adc main). I have also written a few math contests, and hope to do more in the future. 

Discord DMs open @ `doot#7684`, I don't bite :)
