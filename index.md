<p id="describe-text"> hello! i'm marcus ðŸ‘‹ </p>


You might recognize me by the handles I use on most sites - `pidddgy` or `piddddgy`. I started programming in middle school through hackathons and have been doing various computer science things ever since!

Currently I'm in my junior year at the Woodlands Secondary School, where I help out with the computer science club doing stuff like preparing lessons, setting contests, and outreach. As a club exec, something I care about a lot is fostering a friendly and inclusive community for everyone to get excited about computer science <3

In the past I spent a lot of time training for competitive programming contests like the [Canadian Computing Competition](https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing.html), qualifying for the CCO in 2021. My time in competitive programming also allowed me to better appreciate the beauty of math, which I hope to pursue more in university. As part of the [Google Code-in](https://codein.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/) contest, I've also done work in open-source under Sugar Labs, an organization that develops educational software for children. Outside of CS/math related things, I really enjoy dancing - one future goal of mine is to be to devote a significant amount of time solely on training and taking class!

I was a 2021 [ESPR](https://espr-camp.org/) student which was very impactful in many ways. I strongly recommend it for anyone who enjoys thinking about things, wants to make better choices, and aims to lead a more fulfilling life. 


I don't bite! Discord DMs open @ `doot#7684`, I am a very low-risk person to reach out to :)
