## Pre-tips (opening ceremony)

- Be present
    - Notice where your attention is, and where you want it to be
    - What is distracting you from being present? Remove distractions and if stressed about other commitments explicitly plan out when/how you will deal with them
    - Prioritize handling commitments so you won't be distracted
- Just do things
    - Use camp as an opportunity to do whatever you want - the earlier you start the better
    - Think of all the possible versions of you in the future, don't let anxiety/self consciousness/etc hold you back from that
    - This camp has way too much money so just ask for things


## Poker class
- Generic overview of poker rules
- Life can be modelled as a series of bets, so it's high EV to get better at betting
- Studying my behavior and common mistakes
    - When my chips are down I am more likely to make aggressive bets when they are less optimal (ah shit what else can I lose)
    - Being too aggressive if I suspect someone is bluffing, not wanting to feel cheated
    - Sunk cost fallacy
- Calibrating your idea of confidence - being 50% vs 80% sure something is going to happen
